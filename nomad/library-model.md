2050?? (The "Stateless Endpoint" Paradigm)

This is a radical, forward-looking model. It treats local devices as truly ephemeral, stateless compute nodes, exactly like a serverless function or a temporary container. The user's device holds nothing long-term. All state is externalized to the SSOT.

Extremely Pure. This is the most philosophically consistent application of the "cattle, not pets" and "externalized state" principles. It makes zero concessions to the old idea of a "personal computer" as a long-term data store. Its logic is cold, clean, and severe.

Excellent. Data only exists locally for the brief time it's being worked on. The attack surface on the local device is minimized. With rclone crypt, the data is secure at rest and in transit.

Good, but complex. The integrity of the SSOT is high. However, the integrity of the process depends on flawless "commit" operations. A failed commit could lead to lost work. It relies on transactional success.

 Poor. This is the major drawback for a consumer. Need to work on a file? You must have an internet connection to "check it out." No offline access is possible. Availability is entirely dependent on network connectivity to the SSOT.

 Excellent. This is a perfect client-server model where the client is completely stateless. It's the ideal for ephemeral cloud functions and scales infinitely.
