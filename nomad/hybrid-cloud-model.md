Consumer targeted cloud do not need CC
Enterprise/infastrucuter clouds have less lock-in, better apis, but need at CC at signup (privacy). Egress is when data is leaving network. Ingress in when data enters the cloud

If you used opensource data but you use a managed service like RDS. You depend on the cloud to scale the infastrucutre. Using serices accross differnt cloud providers does not work well
  - This is becuase the apis and tech is propreitary it is harder to transfer. The most propreitary tech you use the harder it is to transfer

  - Multi cloud. Pick and choose the best services from the cloud providers
  - Run docker, postgres 

- Hybrid: use your hardware for something and use the cloud for others

Dont use wrappers (vercel)
Provider needs high quality apis, hook it up to a front end like [rclone]() or mountain duck. To make your own platform which is 50/50 self hosted cloud

Define one interface (zsh script) to pull from all clouds. Be 

- Personal file cloud: (s3 provider)
