# Euler's Number

## Overview

**Definition 1**: $e$ is the number such that
$$\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h}=1$$

**Definition 2**: $e$ is the number such that
$$e = \lim_{x \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)^x$$

**Definition**: The unique positive number for which the derivative of that number raised to the $x$ power at $0$ is one  
- When $x$ is 0 the derivative of $e^x = 1$

**Properties**
- Approximation: 2.71828...
- Irrational number; (No pattern and goes on forever)
- Not algebraic (not the solution to quadratic with integer coefficient)
- Transcendental number (transcendental means not algebraic, meaning not the square or cube root of anything). IT is similar to to $\pi$ $\phi$
