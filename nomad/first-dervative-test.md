## Graphing


### Icreating 


### Convavity (The of the cuvarture graph)

**Concave down**: frown 
**Concave up**: cup 
And inflection point is when the curvature changes from 

Concave up mean increaing acceletation (e.g second deriviative). The sign on the second deritive determines concavity

Curavture is ths rate of change of the first derivative
The first deritrivate can be positive rate of changemeaning white it is still going up, it is going up in a smaller in smaller rate
If the fist deritive is increasting then it concave up

### Extrema


If a function has an exrema value it must occur at a critical point 

#### Critical point

**Definition**: 3 ways 
Where the first derivative is = 0. 
the first derivitave does not exist but the function does exist. 
Not all critical values become extrea values 

**Not extrema but crical point** 
- Satllepoints **x^3$$ where $\frac{dy}{dx} = 0$ but it is just a satlle point
- The first deriavite but the function does. It does not correctpond to an extemae. e.g a point of verical tangency. Still not an exrema value


## Mean Value Theorm 

If a derivaitive is positive over an interval the functin is increaing. If negative it is decreaing


### First Deriivative Test

Knowing the critical  points and the poistive you can find relative extrema 
- The extrema must occur at a cricical point

Provided the function is continous, $f$ will have a local maximmum at point $c$ if an only if $f$ goes grom increasing to decreasing at point $c$. Similaryly, $f$ has a local minimum at $c$ if an only if $f$ switches from decreasing to increasing at $c$.

**Relative Max**: positive first deriviative, 0, negative first derivaitive
- Must be condinoust and diffentantlaib.e

**Local mimmumm**: negative first derivative, 0, poositive first deririve

#### Offical Therom
Suppose that $f$ is a continous function over and interval $I$ containing a critical point $c$. If $f$ is diffenentitiab  over $I$, except possibly at point $c$, the $f(c)$ satisfied one of the following descriptiongs:

- i:  If $f'$ changes sign from postiive when $x < c$ and $x > c$, t hen $f(c)$ is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of $f$

- ii. If $f'$ changes sign from negative wheh $x < c$ to positive when $x > c$, then $f(c)$ is a local mimum of $f$

- iii: if $f'$ has the same sign for $x <c$ and $x>c$ then $f(c)$ is neither a local maximum nor a local mimum of $f$. IT is most likey a saddle point or a point of verical tangency 
  - Corneeer, cusp, or point of verical tangecy

#### RUnning the first deriitaive test

1.Find all critical points over given interval 
2. Pick two test point o


### Second deritivate test

Theom: test for convavity 
A point where concativty changes is where an inflection point. btw accletaion is 0 at inflection points

Lets $f$ be a function that is twice differntiable

i. if $f''(x)$ \ge > 0$ fo all x \e I, then $f$ is concave up over $I$
ii. If $f''(x) \lt 0$ for all x \e I, Then $f$ is concave down over $I$


Of course! Here is the text from the image formatted in Markdown with LaTeX for the mathematical expressions.

## The Second Derivative Test

Suppose $f'(c) = 0$, $f''$ is continuous over an interval containing $c$.

i. If $f''(c) > 0$ (concave up), then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
ii. If $f''(c) < 0$ (concave down), then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$.
iii. If $f''(c) = 0$, then the test is inconclusive (fails to work, so you have to use the First Derivative Test).gg
