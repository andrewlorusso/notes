# Euler's Number

## Overview

**Formula**:
$$e = \lim_{x \to \infty} (1+ \frac{1}{x})^x \approx 2.71828...$$


**Definition**: $e$ is the number such that
$$\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{e^h-1}{h}=1$$


### Implications

**Geometric**: Of all possible exponential functions  $y = b^x$, the function $f(x) = e^x$ is the one whose tangent tine at $(0,1)$ has a slope $f'(0)$ that is exactly $1$

**Derivative**: The function's derivative at a point $(x, e^x)$ is equal to the y-coordinate of the point
$$(e^x)^{\prime} = (e^x)$$
