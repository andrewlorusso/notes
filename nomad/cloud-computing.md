# Cloud Computing 

> "The cloud is not just someone else's computer"

## Overview

**Reasons**
- Powerful/enterprise grade hardware: Consumers do not have acess to pentabyes, Xenon cpu with hundrens of cores.

- Enterpise grade software: Advanced filesystem such as zfs scale well with more compute resources, Server farms can benefits from ecnomomies of scale, especially well, e.g pooling computing and other resouces such as storage. ZFS enables this well.

- Reccuring costs: electicity, component wear, etc are all variable costs, and workers to maintain the farms. Cloud computing is a service not just infastrucutre.
