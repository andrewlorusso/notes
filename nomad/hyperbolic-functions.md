Not trig functions at all. They are a type of exponentails; which behavios like a trig function kinda
They get the name becuase the fromulas for their derivatives  their definitions somewhat (but not completeitly)  follow the rules for the basic trig 6 functions 


Shape is like a powerline betwene 
catinary function is a hypbolic funciton
wires and cables do not form parapabola they form hyperboic trig functions
