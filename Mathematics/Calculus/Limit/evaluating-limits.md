# Evaluating Limits

## Overview 

**Premise**: Evaluating a [limit]() is an algorithm, trial and error or tree/flowchart process. The goal is for the function to evaluate to a determinate form. If direct substitution evaluates to an indeterminate form apply its corresponding procedure to rewrite the expression in a new state. Try direct substitution in this new state until the goal is reached.

### Algorithm

1. Try direct substitution (must evaluate to a determinate form)
2. Until DS evaluates to $\mathbb{R}$   
  - Check indeterminate form
    - $\frac{0}{0}$: 
      - Factor out term(s) 
      - Try direct substitution
    - $\frac{\infity}{\infity}\$
        - Divide function by the highest power
        - Try direct substitution
    - $\infty - \infty$
        - Multiply by conjugate

## Indeterminate forms

### $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

**Following procedure**: Divide all terms by the highest power of the variable in the denominator.


### $\frac{0}{0}$

**Case**: Direct substitution of a [rational function]() results $\frac{0}{0}$. This indicates there is removable discontinuity. Factoring out the term which creates the root will create a new function with the same [limit]() at that point.

**Following procedure**: 
- Factor and cancel terms. 
- Multiple by the [conjugate]()

### $\infty - \infty$

**Case**: both terms are scaling to $\left| \infty \right|$, making it impossible to evaluate.

**Following procedure**: Multiply by [conjugate](). This reduce to a ratio where it possible to compare the growth rates of the dominate terms 

### $0 \cdot \infty$

**Case**: Indeterminate. 

**Following procedure**: Rewrite the expression as a fraction.
